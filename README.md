This is a site I made for a photo booth company. The planning phase consisted of discussing the content and design they wanted, making reference to existing sites for the things they'd like to draw from. Then designs in sketch were sent over, feedback was given and finals tweaks were made.

In terms of the tech of the site it's just a simple jekyll static site hosted on github pages. For content editing I used a CMS called [siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/) which integrates well with jekyll and github. It means when updates are made in the nice interface provided by siteleaf, it commits and pushes an update to the YAML files that the jekyll site builds from, hence updating its content.
