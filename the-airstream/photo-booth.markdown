desc: Our professional lighting and stunning floral backdrops combine to create a
  gorgeous collection of photographs recording your event, and our wide selection
  of props ensures that each image is unique and fun. Your choice of props allows
  us to capture the personality and individuality of each guest, as they embrace the
  endless creativity we have to offer. The booth is irresistible to fun-loving guests,
  and we are constantly busy throughout each event, instantly printing images from
  our high-speed printer into the hands of guests eager to capture and preserve the
  moment. The images are at your fingertips from the second we click the camera, and
  can be instantly shared online from our iPad. The photos are also uploaded to your
  own password-protected gallery the next day for everyone to view.
