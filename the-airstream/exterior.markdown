heading: Vintage airstream
desc: "Built in 1949, and model number 15 out of 40 airstreams of her kind, our gorgeous
  airstream “Betsie” has aged remarkably well! She sits on a new chassis and has been
  lovingly restored inside and out. The shining aluminium panels on Betsie’s exterior
  are polished to an immaculate mirror finish to ensure that Betsie is the perfect
  gleaming backdrop for the occasion. \nThe retro ‘PHOTOS’ sign lights up beautifully
  at night and draws people in from afar.\n\nFrom weddings to corporate events, and
  fairgrounds to private parties, Betsie is guaranteed to be an elegant and exciting
  addition to your chosen venue.  \n"
