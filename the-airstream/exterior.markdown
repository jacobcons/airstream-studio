heading: Vintage airstream
desc: A rare vintage airstream “Betsie”, was built back in 1949 and was model number
  15 of only 40 that were ever built. Betsie now sits on a new chassis and has been
  lovingly restored inside and out. We spend hours polishing the outside panels to
  a mirror finish so that the airstream looks great at your event. It makes a great
  backdrop for wedding photos and looks stunning at venues.
